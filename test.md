# Tommaso Bona
## IT & Security Consultant | AI Security Researcher | ADHD & Autism Advocate
### Welcome <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="30">

As an **IT & Security Consultant at Tralerighe Service**, I specialize in architecting secure infrastructures and performing deep-dive security audits for complex environments. My professional journey is rooted in leadership and technical innovation; as the former **Co-Founder and CTO of Voyxa**, I scaled and managed a 20-person cross-functional team—ranging from a 24/7 SOC and GRC experts to AI/ML and DevSecOps departments—overseeing the entire technical lifecycle of AI-driven helpdesk solutions.

Currently, my work is at the intersection of offensive security and Artificial Intelligence. As an **AI Security Researcher**, I investigate novel attack vectors, such as **AFMI (Anchored Fictional Multilingual Injection)**, to harden LLM search-engine pipelines. Parallel to my corporate roles, I am a dedicated **OSINT Analyst** for the Guardian Group's elite PURSUIT® Team, supporting law enforcement in anti-trafficking operations. I am also a proud advocate for **ADHD and Autism awareness**, championing neurodiversity as a critical asset for creative problem-solving in the cybersecurity industry.
