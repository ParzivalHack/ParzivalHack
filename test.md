# Tommaso Bona
## IT & Security Consultant | AI Security Researcher | ADHD & Autism Advocate
### Welcome <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="30">

As a passionate cybersecurity professional and entrepreneur, I currently serve as an **IT & Security Consultant at Tralerighe Service** and an **Independent AI Security Researcher**, specializing in LLMs and AI Model vulnerability discovery. My career is built on a foundation of technical leadership and innovation; as the former **Co-Founder and CTO of Voyxa**, I led a cross-functional team of 20+ PhD students, consultants and engineers to develop our AI-driven vocal Helpdesk solution. Under my technical steering, Voyxa was recognized as a finalist at Digithon (Italy's largest pitch event) and, among other things, i also served as the technical spokesperson, bringing Voyxa from 0 to a **500k$ evaluation**, in only **10 months**.

My transition from a **SOC Analyst and Cybersecurity Specialist**, to a CTO, and now a specialized Consultant, has allowed me to blend deep technical expertise with strategic business development. I also worked as a **Business Development Advisor and Marketing Strategist for StationX**, where I proposed and helped guide the creation of their new white papers platform, all of which started, with me working remotely for StationX as a "simple" **Cybersecurity Writer**, for a bit more than a year. Beyond the corporate world, I am a volunteer **OSINT Analyst** for the Guardian Group's PURSUIT® Team, helping fight child exploitation, together with law enforcement, i've had the privilege of contributing to the **Python Software Foundation**, and i'm a proud advocate for **ADHD and Autism awareness**, championing neurodiversity as a vital asset for innovation in the current cybersecurity landscape.
