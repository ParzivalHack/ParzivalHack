# Tommaso Bona
## IT & Security Consultant | AI Security Researcher | ADHD & Autism Advocate
### Welcome <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="30">

As a passionate cybersecurity professional and entrepreneur, I currently serve as an **IT & Security Consultant at Tralerighe Service** and an **AI Security Researcher** specializing in LLM vulnerability discovery. My career is built on a foundation of technical leadership and innovation; as the **Co-Founder and former CTO of Voyxa**, I led a cross-functional team of 12+ PhD students and engineers to develop AI-driven vocal helpdesk solutions. Under my technical steering, Voyxa was recognized as a finalist at Digithon—Italy's largest pitch event—and I served as the technical spokesperson to help secure **€100k in pre-seed investments**.

My transition from a **SOC Analyst** to a CTO and now a specialized Consultant has allowed me to blend deep technical expertise with strategic business development. I am also a **Business Development Advisor and Marketing Strategist for StationX**, where I proposed and now oversee their new white papers platform. Beyond the corporate world, I am an **OSINT Analyst** for the Guardian Group's PURSUIT® Team, a contributor to the **Python Software Foundation**, and a proud advocate for **ADHD and Autism awareness**, championing neurodiversity as a vital asset for innovation in the cybersecurity landscape.
